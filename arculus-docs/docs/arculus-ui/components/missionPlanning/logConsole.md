# LogConsole Component

## Overview
The `<LogConsole />` component displays an activity log, capturing real-time actions and events in the system. It is designed to help users monitor operational statuses, warnings, and errors during various processes.

## Component Functionality
This component is primarily used to display logging information to users, allowing them to:
1. **Monitor System Activity**: Provides a live feed of system operations, helping users track the progress and status of different tasks.
2. **Error and Warning Visibility**: Highlights critical information and alerts, aiding in quick diagnostics and troubleshooting.
3. **Scrollable Log View**: Supports a scrolling mechanism to accommodate the continuous addition of new log entries without losing the older logs from the view.

## Design Details
- **Container Style**:
  - Background Color: Black for high contrast with white text.
  - Text Color: White, providing excellent readability against the black background.
  - Border: A subtle `#333` border that delineates the log area without overwhelming the main content.
- **Text Style**:
  - Font Size: Optimized at `13px` for clear legibility.
  - Text Alignment: Left-aligned to maintain a consistent and orderly appearance of log entries.

## Usage
The `<LogConsole />` component can be integrated into any part of an application where real-time logging information is essential, such as in:
- **Command centers** for surveillance systems.
- **Administrative dashboards** managing automated processes.
- **Development environments** for debugging and testing.

## Layout
This component takes the full width of its parent container to maximize the display area for logs. The height is set to 60% of its container to balance visibility with other UI elements, ensuring that the log console does not dominate the interface.

In essence, the `<LogConsole />` component acts as a critical tool for real-time data monitoring, providing insights and alerts in a user-friendly and accessible format.
