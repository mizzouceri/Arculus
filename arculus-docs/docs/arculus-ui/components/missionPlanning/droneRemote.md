# DroneRemote Component

## Overview
The `<DroneRemote />` component provides a graphical interface for remotely controlling drones. It features a set of directional controls that allow users to command drone movements in a simulated environment.

## Component Functionality
This component allows for the remote operation of drones via a user-friendly interface, which includes:
1. **Directional Movement Controls**: Users can command the drone to move in eight directions using arrow buttons.
2. **Central Control Button**: A prominent central button provides access to additional drone functionalities, represented by a `SettingsRemoteIcon` from Material UI icons.

## Design Details
- **Control Selection**: A dropdown menu allows the user to select between different types of drones, such as Surveillance or Supply drones, altering the control commands accordingly.
- **Arrow Buttons**: Customized arrow buttons are designed to visually represent different movement directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
- **Central Button**:
  - Utilizes a bright blue color for high visibility.
  - Circular design for ergonomic interaction.
  - Features a large `SettingsRemoteIcon` for intuitive operation.

## Usage
The `<DroneRemote />` component is used in applications where remote control of drones is necessary, such as in drone training simulators, remote delivery systems, or surveillance operations. It enhances user interaction by providing immediate visual feedback and simple control mechanisms.

## Layout
- **Remote Controller Interface**: Mimics a traditional remote controller with a straightforward layout, promoting ease of use and quick adaptation for new users.
- **Responsive Buttons**: The buttons respond to user input with visual changes, ensuring users receive feedback when actions are taken.

This component not only simplifies drone operations but also enriches the user's interaction experience with intuitive design and clear functionality.
