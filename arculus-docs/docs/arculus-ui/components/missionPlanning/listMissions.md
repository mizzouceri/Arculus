# ListMissions Component

## Overview
The `<ListMissions />` component is responsible for fetching and displaying a list of missions based on the user's role. It allows mission creators to execute and delete missions, while supervisors and viewers can monitor ongoing missions.

## Component Functionality
This component integrates critical mission management functionalities tailored for different user roles within a sophisticated mission planning and monitoring interface.

### Features
- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Fetches missions dynamically based on the user typeâ€”creator, supervisor, or viewer.
- **Mission Execution**: Allows mission creators to start missions if they are not in an 'IN EXECUTION', 'SUCCESSFUL', or 'ABORTED' state.
- **Monitoring and Deletion**: Provides mechanisms for monitoring ongoing missions and deleting missions when necessary, with safeguards to prevent deletion during execution.

### User Interaction
- **Execute Mission**: Mission creators can initiate a mission execution directly from the list.
- **View Mission Details**: Users can view detailed information about the mission setup and status.
- **Delete Mission**: Mission creators can remove missions that are no longer needed or relevant.

## Design Details
- **Visual Layout**: Utilizes a `Table` from Material-UI to present mission data in a structured format.
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes `IconButton` components for actions like executing and deleting missions.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Uses dialogs to confirm deletion requests and displays loading indicators during mission execution.

## Usage
`<ListMissions />` is used in the mission management dashboard where users with different roles manage their missions. It is a crucial component for maintaining operational oversight and control over mission lifecycles.
