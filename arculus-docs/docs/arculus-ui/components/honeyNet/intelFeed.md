# Intel Feed Component
## Overview
The `<IntelFeed />` component is essential for viewing detailed intelligence data filtered by various parameters such as honeypot type, protocol, and time frame. It provides insights into the interactions and attacks on different honeypots, helping users make informed decisions about their cybersecurity strategies.

## Component Functionality
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Users can filter the data based on honeypot type, protocol, time frame, and the number of records. This allows for customized views of intelligence data relevant to specific needs.
- **Pagination**: Implements pagination to manage and navigate through large datasets effectively, ensuring the interface remains responsive and the data is accessible.
- **Interactive Elements**: The component includes interactive elements, such as clickable IP addresses, which can trigger a context switch to detailed attacker statistics, enhancing the investigative process.

## Design and Layout
- **Flexible Layout**: The component's layout adjusts dynamically based on the filters applied, maintaining a user-friendly interface regardless of the data volume.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures that the component works seamlessly across different devices, providing a consistent user experience.

## Data Handling
- **Efficient Data Fetching**: Data is fetched efficiently from a backend API, with considerations for network efficiency and error handling.
- **Context Integration**: Utilizes the dashboard context to manage global state across the dashboard, facilitating seamless interactions across different components.

## Extensibility
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle increases in data volume without significant modifications.
- **Modularity**: The component's modular design makes it easy to integrate new features or adjust existing functionalities.
