# HoneypotDashboard Component

## Overview
The `HoneypotDashboard` component provides an interface within the application to manage and deploy honeypots. It's designed to simplify the administration of network security tools by offering a user-friendly dashboard. This dashboard includes tabs for viewing deployed honeypots and deploying new ones.

## Component Functionality
- **Tab Navigation**: Allows users to switch between two main views:
  1. **Deployed HoneyPots**: Displays a list of currently deployed honeypots.
  2. **Deploy HoneyPots**: Provides an interface to configure and deploy new honeypots.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React's `useState` hook to manage the active tab state, ensuring that the user's tab selection is maintained across re-renders.
- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Based on the active tab, the component conditionally renders the appropriate content, enhancing the application's responsiveness and interactivity.

## Design Details
- **Typography**: Uses Material-UI's `Typography` component to ensure consistent and accessible text across the dashboard.
- **Navigation Buttons**:
  - Styling: Each button is styled to indicate the active state, improving the user's navigation experience.
  - Interaction: Buttons change the displayed content without reloading the page, providing a smooth user experience.
- **CSS Integration**: Incorporates custom CSS for layout and styling, ensuring that the dashboard is visually appealing and aligned with the application's design theme.

In summary, the `HoneypotDashboard` provides essential tools for network administrators and cybersecurity professionals to deploy and manage honeypots effectively, thereby enhancing the security posture of their networks.
