# DeviceManagement Component
## Overview
The `<DeviceManagement />` component is a central part of the device management system within the application. It provides an interface for system administrators to manage device configurations, approve new devices, update device details, and remove devices from the system.

## Component Functionality
The `<DeviceManagement />` component performs several key functions:
1. **List and Manage Devices:** Displays all devices within the system, allowing admins to configure, update, or remove devices.
2. **Handle Device Requests:** Manages incoming requests for adding devices to the cluster, including approval and denial of these requests.
3. **State Management:** Maintains the state of all devices, device requests, and any actions being performed on them.
4. **Error Handling:** Displays error messages and handles exceptions if issues occur during the fetch or update operations.

## APIs Used
- **[`/device/getTrustedDevices`](/docs/arculus-api/Device#get-gettrusteddevices) API:** Fetches a list of all trusted devices in the system.
- **[`/device/getMoreNodes`](/docs/arculus-api/Device#get-getmorenodes) API:** Retrieves additional devices that are pending approval to join the cluster.
- **[`/device/addToCluster`](/docs/arculus-api/Device#post-addtrusteddevice) API:** Handles requests to add devices to the cluster.
- **[`/device/removeFromCluster`](/docs/arculus-api/Device#delete-removefromcluster) API:** Manages requests to remove devices from the cluster.

## Design and Interaction
- **Modal Components:** Utilizes modal dialogs for adding and editing device details, providing a focused context for user input without leaving the device management dashboard.
- **Dynamic Content Loading:** Information about devices and cluster status is dynamically loaded and refreshed to ensure up-to-date data presentation.
- **Responsive Actions:** Actions such as approving or denying device requests, and adding or removing devices are handled in real-time with immediate feedback on the UI.

## Security and Authentication
- Ensures that all API calls are made with appropriate authentication tokens, and that user actions are validated both client-side and server-side to maintain system integrity and security.

## Error Management
- Provides robust error handling mechanisms to catch and display errors during API interactions, enhancing the reliability of the component and improving user experience during failures.
