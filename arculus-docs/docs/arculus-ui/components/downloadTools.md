# DownloadTools Component
## Overview
The `<DownloadTools />` component allows users to download essential scripts directly from the user interface or via command-line instructions. It provides options for downloading the Arculus Join Request Wizard and the Honeypot Wizard, and includes functionality for copying command-line instructions to the clipboard.

## Component Functionality
- **Direct Download Buttons**: Users can directly download scripts for setting up their environment.
- **Command-line Instruction**: Provides a dynamically generated script that users can copy to clipboard and run in their CLI to perform the same setup.
- **Node Name Input**: Users can specify the node name which is then incorporated into the command-line script.

## Design and Structure
- **User Interaction**: Utilizes Material UI components for a cohesive and accessible user interface, including buttons, text fields, and icons.
- **Script Generation**: Dynamically generates a shell script based on user input for the node name.
- **Clipboard Functionality**: Includes a button to copy the generated script to the clipboard, enhancing user convenience.

## Usage
This component is primarily used by users needing to install and configure tools provided by the platform. It simplifies the process by offering both graphical and command-line options.

## Implementation Details
- **Script Generation**: The script is generated based on the API URLs configured in the application settings and includes error handling for failed downloads.
- **Material UI Theme**: Wrapped in a `ThemeProvider` for consistent styling across the application.
