# Layout Component
## Overview
The `<Layout />` component serves as the primary structural element of the application's user interface. It orchestrates the sidebar navigation, main content area, and top application bar.

## Component Functionality
- **Dynamic Sidebar**: Features a collapsible sidebar that allows users to navigate between different sections of the application.
- **App Bar**: Includes an app bar with a menu button, notification icons, and user-specific actions like sign out.
- **Responsive Drawer**: The sidebar can toggle between expanded and collapsed states, adjusting the main content area accordingly.
- **Notification and User Management**: Implements user notifications and manages user sessions using cookies.

## Design and Structure
- **Material UI**: Utilizes Material UI components for consistent styling and responsive design.
- **Styled Components**: Uses styled components for customizing the Material UI Drawer and AppBar.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Connects to a WebSocket for real-time updates, particularly for displaying pending actions.
- **User Authentication**: Checks user authentication status and handles redirection if not authenticated.

## Usage
This component is used as the main layout wrapper for all pages that require user authentication and navigation. It ensures that the user interface is consistent across different parts of the application.

## Implementation Details
- **Theme Configuration**: Uses a custom theme provided by `ThemeProvider` to maintain consistent styling.
- **Routing and Navigation**: Integrates with `react-router-dom` for navigating between pages based on user interactions.
- **User Session Management**: Manages user sessions and performs actions like sign out and checking user status against an authentication API.
