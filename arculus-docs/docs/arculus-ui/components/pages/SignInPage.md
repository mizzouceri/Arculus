# SignInPage Component
## Overview
The `<SignInPage />` component serves as a dedicated container for the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/arculus-ui/components/signin) component, encapsulating the user authentication interface in a standalone page. This approach modularizes the sign-in process, making it both reusable and easy to maintain.

## Component Structure
- **Page Container**: Provides a wrapper (`div` with class `page-container`) that standardizes the layout and styling across the application's various pages.
- **SignIn Component Integration**: Directly incorporates the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/arculus-ui/components/signin) component, ensuring that the sign-in functionalities are centrally managed and accessible.

## Design and Styling
- **Consistency in User Interface**: Maintains a consistent look and feel with other pages, promoting a uniform user experience throughout the application.
- **Focused User Interaction**: By isolating the sign-in process on a dedicated page, it minimizes distractions, directing user focus solely to authentication tasks.

## Usage
Typically used as the landing page for unauthenticated users, redirecting to the main content of the application upon successful sign-in. This setup enhances security by segregating authentication mechanisms from the rest of the application's functionalities.
